# Car-price-prediction

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<h3>Accurate car price prediction is essential for buyers, sellers, and dealerships. This project utilizes historical car listings and applies Lasso Regression—a regularized linear regression technique—to create a predictive model that generalizes well on unseen data.</h3>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
